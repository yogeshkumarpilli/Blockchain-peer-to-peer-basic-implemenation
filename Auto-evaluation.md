## Project Results:
## Working aspects:
- Cheese mining and validation
- P2P and tracker connections
- In the cheesestack, the cheese has the following features - index,timestamp,transaction,previous hash,nounce, and its hash.
- Saving and loading the cheesestack in JSON file
## Missing aspects
- Incomplete GUI with limited functionality
- Missing feature to request updated cheese stack from other peers
- Blockchain automation not yet tested
- Addition of advanced features to the blockchain can be explored
## Conclusion
- Initial objective was to build a simple blockchain and it was successful
- The stress tests were not much explored because of lack of time
- Usage of git was not adequate but we managed to use it for major part of the project

## Usage of GIT in our project:

- We have made sure that all the member have their own branch for testing purpose. Eventually, we have merged all the codes in one file. While pushing the commit message was fairly descriptive.
